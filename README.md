# OpenCV Computer Vision Toolkit

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of computer vision demonstrations implemented in Python using OpenCV. It provides hands-on examples of classic and modern image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and geometric transformations.

Core Modules
- Image filtering and convolution
- Thresholding and segmentation
- Edge detection and contour analysis
- Haar-cascade object detection
- Feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB)
- Feature matching and tracking
- Homography and perspective correction
- Color space conversions and masking

Theoretical Foundations
1. Convolution kernels for smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection  
2. Global and adaptive thresholding for binary segmentation  
3. Haar-like features with cascade classifiers for rapid detection  
4. Keypoint extraction and descriptor computation for robust matching  
5. RANSAC-based homography estimation for planar transformations  
6. Color theory for converting, masking, and analyzing different channels  

Repository Structure
- `examples/` – Individual scripts demonstrating each feature  
- `data/` – Sample images and videos for quick experimentation  
- `notebooks/` – Interactive Jupyter notebooks with detailed commentary  
- `utils/` – Helper modules for common preprocessing tasks  

Highlights
- Real-time face and eye detection with adjustable parameters  
- Edge and contour analysis illustrating shape extraction
