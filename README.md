# OpenCV Computer Vision Toolkit
## Core Concepts
- **Image Processing**: Filtering, transformations, and feature extraction.  
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and localizing objects in images and video.  
- **Feature Matching**: Comparing regions across frames for tracking.  
- **Machine Learning**: Integrating classifiers for scene understanding.

## Repository Highlights
- **Real-Time Face Detection** with Haar Cascades  
- **Edge Detection & Contour Analysis**  
- **Color Space Transformations** and Masking

- **Homography & Perspective Mapping**

## Theoretical Foundations
1. **Convolution**  
   Core operation for filtering and edge detection.  
2. **Thresholding**  
   Segment images by pixel intensity to isolate regions.  
3. **Haar-like Features**  
   Rapid detection via simple rectangular patterns.  
4. **Feature Descriptors**  
   SIFT, SURF, ORB to encode and match keypoints.  
5. **Geometric Transformations**  
   Map coordinates across views to correct perspective.
